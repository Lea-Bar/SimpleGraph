## How to use it ?
To get started, simply enter your graph's edges in the textbox using the following format: ```node1 node2 weight (optional)```, here's an exemple:

    ```
    A B 2
    D E 4
    ```

    We have an edge A => B with a weight of 2 and an edge D => E with a weight of 4.

Once you add your edges, the graph will be automatically generated using a grid-based layout.

You can choose between Undirected and Directed graphs based on what you need.

You can adjust the positions of the nodes by dragging them around on the canvas.
